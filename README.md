# Citation

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/unitedstates/citation.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/unitedstates/citation)

A fast, stand-alone legal citation extractor.

Currently supports:

* US Code
* US Public and Private Laws (slip laws)
* US Statutes at Large
* DC Code
* DC Register
* Judicial citations (using [walverine](https://github.com/adelevie/walverine))

Compatible in-browser with modern Firefox, Chrome, and IE **9+**.

## Install

[Install Node.js and NPM](http://nodejs.org/#download), then install Citation globally (may require `sudo`):

```bash
npm install -g citation
```

Or install it locally to a `node_modules` directory with `npm install citation`.

## [Javascript API Documentation](JS_API.md)

## [HTTP API Documentation](HTTP_API.md)

Citation provides a server interface for HTTP requests, returning JSON data
for specific citations.

## Command line

The shell command can accept a string to parse as an argument, through STDIN,
or from a file. It can output results to STDOUT, or to a file.

```bash
cite "section 5362(5) of title 31"

echo "section 5362(5) of title 31" | cite

cite --input=in-file.txt --output=out-file.json

cite "pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1)(E) and"
```

### Options

* `--input`: Filename to read text from
* `--output`: Filename to output text to
* `--pretty`: Prettify (indent) output
* `--types`: Limit citation types to a comma-separated list (e.g. "usc,law")

## Server deployment

See [etc/](etc) for an example upstart script to keep `cite-server` running in production.

## Cite-specific options

You can pass arbitrary options to individual citators, if that citator supports them.

By using a key is the key of a citator, e.g. `usc` or `dc_code`, that citator's processors will get the value of that key passed in as an argument.

### Example: DC Code relative cites

For example, the `dc_code` citator accepts a `source` option, to indicate
what the text source is. If the value of `source` is itself "dc_code",
then the citator will apply a looser pattern to detect internal cites.

That looks like this:

```javascript
Citation.find("required under ยง 3-101.01(13)(e), the Commission shall perform the", {
  dc_code: {source: "dc_code"}
})
```

That will match `ยง 3-101.01(13)(e)`, because the `dc_code` citator assumes it's processing the text of the DC Code itself, and internal references are unambiguous.

### Tests

This project is tested with [nodeunit](https://github.com/caolan/nodeunit).

To run tests, you'll need to install this project from source and install its
node dependencies:

```
git clone git@github.com:unitedstates/citation.git
cd citation
npm install
npm test
```

Test cases are stored in the `test` directory. Each test case covers a subsection
of the code and ensures that citations are correctly detected: for instance, see
[test/stat.js](test/stat.js).

To run all tests:

```bash
nodeunit test
```

To run a specific test:

```bash
nodeunit test/usc.js
```
